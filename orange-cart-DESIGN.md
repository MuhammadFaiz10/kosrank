# Orange Cart

## Overview
A utilitarian, high-density design system built for commerce at massive scale. Orange Cart prioritizes information density, fast scanning, and frictionless purchasing over visual elegance. The aesthetic is functional and familiar — dense grids, clear price hierarchies, prominent trust signals, and a signature orange that universally means "buy now." Every design decision serves conversion.

## Typography
- **Display Font**: Source Sans 3 — loaded from Google Fonts
- **Body Font**: Source Sans 3 — loaded from Google Fonts
- **Code Font**: JetBrains Mono — loaded from Google Fonts

Source Sans 3 is used throughout, matching the humanist sans-serif character of the original system. Headlines use weight 700 for product titles and price displays. Body text uses weight 400 for descriptions and weight 600 for emphasis (review counts, feature highlights). The type scale is deliberately compact — large sizes are rare. Most content lives at 13-14px for maximum information density. Line heights are tight (1.3-1.4x) to pack more content above the fold.

- **Page Title**: Source Sans 3 28px/36px, weight 700
- **Section Title**: Source Sans 3 21px/28px, weight 700
- **Product Title**: Source Sans 3 18px/24px, weight 400 (titles are normal weight for scannability)

## Elevation
Elevation is minimal and structural. Level 0: flat, no shadow — most elements. Level 1: 0 2px 5px rgba(15,17,17,0.08) — for product cards on hover and floating action bars. Level 2: 0 0 6px rgba(15,17,17,0.15) — for dropdown menus, mega-menus, and popovers. Borders are the primary separation method, not shadows. Cards use 1px #D5D9D9 borders to define boundaries. The header casts a subtle Level 1 shadow to separate it from content. Sticky elements (buy box, Add to Cart) use Level 2 when scrolled.

## Components

## Do's and Don'ts
- Do prioritize information density — users are scanning, not browsing
- Do show price prominently with the largest weight in any product display
- Don't use the orange (#FF9900) for text — it fails accessibility contrast on white backgrounds
- Do use #007185 (teal) for all text links — it's the established interactive text color
- Don't add decorative whitespace — every pixel should serve commerce
- Do show social proof (ratings, review counts, "Best Seller" badges) near product titles
- Don't hide the Add to Cart button — it must be visible without scrolling on product pages
- Do use the gold gradient (#FFD814 to #FFA41C) for purchase buttons to differentiate from other CTAs
- Don't use light font weights — dense layouts require weight 400 minimum for body text readability
- Do support keyboard navigation with visible cyan focus rings on all interactive elements
